This repository contains the completed "on the job ticket" for Coding Bootcamp Challenge 01.

## Completed Project

Find the finished product [here](https://rainbow-rabanadas-eb6a30.netlify.app/).

## Learning Objectives

- Solidify basic HTML and CSS knowledge
- Practice git commands in the CLI
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability
- Practice creating usable and informative README files

## Acceptance Criteria

User was given starter code and prompted with the following Acceptance Criteria:

- WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the icon and image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Review

Throughout this project, I encountered several problems that needed to be fixed in order to meet the guidelines laid out for me. This required conducting my own research and figuring out how to solve different issues. The updated HTML and CSS files are now more correctly formatted, and each element works as intended.
